proposal on clothing which supports controlling negative emotions

## **Emotion-Supportive Vest and Ring**

**Overview**
This project proposes a wearable technology solution aimed at supporting emotional well-being through a combination of a unisex adjustable vest and a companion ring. The vest integrates physiological sensors to monitor real-time indicators such as temperature, skin conductance, and heart rate. Based on these inputs, the ring provides feedback to help manage negative emotions by vibrating to distract the wearer and displaying emotional states through colored lights. Additionally, a calming countdown feature on the ring assists in regulating emotions.
